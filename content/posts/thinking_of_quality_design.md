> 🍎本文源自对Apple WWDC 2018 的一次公开分享的记录提炼。什么是优秀的设计，它为什么重要，如何追求品质感……这些话题不仅是设计师需要考虑的专业问题，也是每个人打造自己的生活需要知道的内在规律。[Video](https://developer.apple.com/cn/videos/play/wwdc2018/801/)

# What Is Quality

优秀的设计很难用一段术语定义，但人一眼就可以识别它。
- Different to different people... What we agree is "good".
- Not random. A lot of care and time went into it. Feels like someone has thought of you already
- Not painful to use in any way.
- Feels state of art, easier to get things done with less distraction.

这里单独展开说一下Care。所谓“好产品是有温度的”，大抵说的是同一个道理。这种来自人类的同理心，正是2025的当下，AI最难以取代的人类品质之一。

# Why Quality Matters
- It impacts the world that we interact with in so many different ways, all the time throughout our day.
- Through quality users can feel your intentions, which invokes trust. **`Quality have to be earned, not just to be claimed`**.

好的设计之所以重要，是它能让我们心情好、效率高。用户会自然的通过好的设计感知到开发者的用心良苦，产生商业中最高价值：信任🤝。


# Rules Of Quality Design
- Simplicity. Does not have to do much, **`but what it does, it does really well`**.
- It just has to work, making life feel a little bit easier/nicer.
- It is stunning and polished, like a game.
  - How do you learn the rules of a game? A gool game makes you stay curious and **`discover the rules by yourself as a reward`** during interacting with game world.
- It is timeless.
- It is positive. Not only something unique, but also the substantial positive effect on the user.

简洁好用，即用即走。这也是张小龙做微信时的秘诀之一。除了有用，还有一点是有趣，就像电子游戏那样让用户把学习使用产品使用当作一种奖励，而不是认知负担。要做到这一点需要大量心血打磨。

# How To Persue Quality
- Put yourself in other's shoes.
- **`Prototyping`**. Don't just design on paper and assume it will work. You've really got to go out and try it.
- **`Learn from feedback, not just be defensive`**.
  - After you've used your own product some amount of time, you naturally develop some blind spots.
- Be patient. You cannot hire more people to get there faster. **`Great artists are patient`**.
- Be modesty, be mindful.
