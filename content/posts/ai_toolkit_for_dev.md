# For General Task

- üî•Open AI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login), and Plugins. GPT3.5 is free to use.
- üî•Microsoft's [NewBing](https://www.bing.com/new). It's said to be powered by GPT4 (internal version).
- Google's [Bard](https://bard.google.com/).

 > After trying so many LLM, ChatGPT is still the best one to be professional and smart. But I still prefer asking different models to get different point of view.

# For Document
- Edge + NewBing. Explain any webpage (including PDF) side by side.
- [ChatDoc](https://chatdoc.com/)/[ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/), upload PDF and analyze.
- Microsoft's Copilot.

# For Code

- Github's [Copilot X](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x), exsiting Copilot costs $10/mo after 60d trial.
  - Using [Copilot for Docs](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-for-docs) to learn a SDK/framework/API.
  > The gist is, to describe a single-responsibility function to let AI generate, rather than a function with long description of chained operations.

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so/), or CodeCursor(vscode plugin), analyze opened document/code, currently FREE.

# For 3D/2D Art
- üî•[Stable-Diffusion (SD) web-ui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), totally free and opensource, run model locally on PC.
  - Download/Share models on [civitai](https://civitai.com/content/guides/what-is-civitai)/[Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/)
  - Use [ControlNet](https://stablediffusionweb.com/ControlNet) ([Github](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) )to add more controll on specific SD model.
  - Use [LoRA (Low-rank adaption)](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) to train faster with less memory.
  - Use [Text Inversion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/text_inversion) to train with amazingly small output.
  - Use [DreamBooth] to train if you need to be really expressive.

- üî•[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/),  famous for its artistic style, ~~25 times FREE try~~.
- Adobe's [Firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/)
- Open AI's [DALL-E-2](https://labs.openai.com/), generates image with natural language and long prompts, but limited-access and less control.
- Bing's [Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create), generate image with natural language, and free to try.

# For Music
- [Mubert](https://mubert.com/)

# Want more power?

If you want to:
- train your own AI based on these models
- know the strength and weakness of current AI models
- know why & how Generative AI works, mathematically

Here are my personal ideas:
- For text, play with [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)/[llama.cpp]((https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) ), or its fined tuned version [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)/[Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora). For image, play with [Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion). They can run on PC/Mac.
- Weakness of current LLM models: math; chain of decision. But they are improving.
